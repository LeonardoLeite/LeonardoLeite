# 👋 Hi there, I'm Leo

I’m a **Full Stack Developer** and **Engineering Lead**, with over **15 years of experience** in software development, systems integration, and IT infrastructure management.

I started my career working with **Java EE** and **iOS development**, later expanding into **full stack web development** with **Vue.js**, **Node.js**, and **MySQL**. Today, I lead technology initiatives within a Brazilian government agency, focusing on innovation, transparency, and digital transformation.
